In the standard Odoo the UI option 'Grant_portal_access' that is present in the 'Action' menu
of any list view is always enabled (for every user).

This module makes the option 'Grant_portal_access' enabled only for the users that belong
to the Grant_portal_access Data group.

Admin user can always use the grant_portal_access option.
