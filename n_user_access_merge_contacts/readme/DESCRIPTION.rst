In the standard Odoo the UI option 'Merge_contacts' that is present in the 'Action' menu
of any list view is always enabled (for every user).

This module makes the option 'Merge_contacts' enabled only for the users that belong
to the Merge_contacts Data group.

Admin user can always use the merge_contacts option.
